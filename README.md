# Room Condition Checker
IoT Project by: Reegan Anto.J

Webdev and Deployment: Dinesh

## Introduction:
This is an IoT based electrical circuit using Arduino UNO board which reads data from DHT11 sensor and photoresistor in order to obtain temperature, humidity and photoresistor and I use the ESP8266EX wifi module to update the data to my ThingSpeak channel whose API key is then read and visualized by the frontend deployed on vercel.
